                Having a strong interest in video games and FPS’s in particular the idea of creating one instantly appealed to me and especially the creating of a 3D environment. This is a skill I truly want to master and this project will contribute towards it greatly. Having only worked in groups of two before in big projects, I look forward to working as a group and combining efforts to create something fun !</div>

                Throughout my highschool years, by taking the NSI class I was able to participate in a multitude of projects such as for example a battleship game. I’ve also been playing videogames my whole life and in particular FPS games. So being given the opportunity to create our own FPS game is really fascinating to me, the creation of it, how the game works, etc.

                Since I was young, I have always been interested in IT and science in gen- eral thanks to my father. I have been playing various video games for quite a long time and despite my lack of experience in FPS, I think I can con- tribute to the project in many other fields. I also particularly appreciate group work and I have already participated in several computer-related projects throughout my schooling, especially in my NSI class. So I am highly motivated to participate in the creation of this project.

                I don’t play a lot of video games but I have always been interested in digital design and have already use softwares like Blender so I am excited to learn how to put that knowledge into creating a game and the world around it. Besides, I have worked never on a multiplayer game so this project will allow me to learn more about it. Finally, I look forward to working with the team and to see how well we can gather our experiences and knowledge to create FPSheesh.

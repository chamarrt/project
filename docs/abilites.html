            <div class="inside"><h3> Initial Idea :</h3> We wanted our game to have a special mechanic, such that our players could enjoy a new FPS as there are many already available. So we came up with the idea to implement the “sheesh” mimic in our game. <br>
                To do that we came up with several “abilities” that the player will en- counter all throughout the game that he can use on himself using the sheesh mimic. Some of the boosts that will be granted by these abil- isheesh are for example : <br>
                - JumpBoost which is the ability to make your character jump higher, Speed which makes your character go at a higher velocity <br>
                - Berserk is the ability to make your bullets do more damage to the enemy but also take more damage <br>
                - Transcendence which gives you information on the enemy’s movements <br> - Invisibility which makes your character invisible <br>
                - FastReload which makes the reload times much faster <br>
                - Revive which makes your redeployment to the battle faster if used before your death <br>
                - Troll boy which creates clone of yourself to confuse your enemy <br>
                - Tanky which creates a shield around you that blocks an amount of damage.

            <div class="inside"> <h3>First Defense : </h3> 
            
                For the first defense, we wanted to have about 50% of the abili- ties done, we decided to do 4 abilities : <br>
                - a dash ability which makes the character leap forward, <br>
                - a speed boost, which boosts the char- acter’s movement speed <br>
                - a jump boost ability which makes the character’s jump height increase <br>- a strength ability which makes it so that the user’s bullets do more damage to the enemy <br>
                Each ability was coded so that at the press of a button, the cor- responding ability begins. To do that, Tom learned how to code through unity by looking at multiple tutorials online and applying what he learned to the needs he had. <br>
                The way they work is pretty simple as they just influence the base stats of the character for example, the jump boost ability simply increases the user’s jumpHeight variable for a certain time.

            <div class="inside"><h3> Second Defense :</h3>
                After having created several abilities such as speed, jump boost
and strength for the first defense, we wanted to have around 75%
of the abilities done for the second one , already having 50% of
them done.  <br>
Tom decided to add two more abilities, a healing ability which
gives 25hp to the player and an ability that gave you a mag with
more bullets. <br>
These two abilities work similarly to the ones made beforehand
using the same principle, affecting the base stats of the characters
when a button is pressed. <br>
Tom has yet to implement the class system so right now every
ability is available to use but that will change and that is the last
15% left in the abilities category.
<h3>Finished Product :</h3>
For this final defense, Tom had to complete the class selection system. The class system in this game is pretty basic, you are given the choice between multiple classes, once this choice is made, the player will spawn in with the corresponding character skin and ability. i.e. if you decide to pick the dasher, you will get his skin and the ability to dash around your surroundings. <br>
He did that by creating a user interface in the same style as the previous UI with different classes to choose from such as the dasher, the healer etc. <br> This was quite a tricky task as he had a lot of trouble figuring out how after the click of a button one skin would be selected, the transmission of data between two scenes and two scripts ended up being hard for him but once that challenge was overcome, the rest was relatively easy as the code made by Tom was well organized and easy to tweek in order to make it so that each ability would not be available to every class for example.

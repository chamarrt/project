    <h2>Our Project</h2>
    
    <div class="presentation">
         FPSheesh is a First Person Shooter game in which players will use weapons to fight other players in different environments.
            Many steps are needed as the team will offer a multiplayer game which implies server management to allow multiple connections among other tasks. Each of those tasks was assigned to two group members : the one in charge along with a substitute.

    <h2>WHERE DO FPSs COME FROM ? </h2> 
    First-person shooter (FPS) is a subgenre of shooter video games centered on gun and other weapon-based combat in a first-person perspective, with the player experiencing the action through the eyes of the protagonist and controlling the player character in a three-dimensional space.
    The first appearance of such a game was in 1992 with Wolfenstein, a critical and commercial success that went on to be considered one of the greatest video games ever made, selling over 250,000 copies 3 years after release which for the time was a big success. space.
    The next big title was Doom that created a huge amount of hype around FPS’s and for some time after its release, any games of the genre to come after were called Doom Clones.
    Whilst these games were gaining in popularity, at the time all FPS games that were coming out were single player, a user usually followed a story line shooting his way through levels. But in our case we want to take a more modern approach, multiplayer FPS’s. This genre really affirmed itself when Epic dropped Unreal Tournament in 1999, one of the first purely
    multiplayer-focused FPS titles. From there on a whole new category appeared, player against player titles. The game from which we draw our main source of inspiration would be the Call of Duty franchise. With a fast-paced gameplay based around rounds.

    <h2>STRUCTURE OF OUR GAME </h2> 
    When the player wants to play he choses on what map he wants to fight and in what game-mode (Free-for-all, Team deathmatch, Capture the Flag). <br>
    • He loads into a game with x players. The player then plays differently according to the game mode. The player earns points by killing other players or fulfilling objectives. <br>
    • At the start of each round or when he dies, the player chooses a kit that comes with a weapon and an “abilisheesh”. <br>
    • FPSheesh’s own mechanic comes with the ability to use a special “abilisheesh” that gives many different bonuses such as movement speed, more control over guns etc. These stims can be obtained when the player earns x points. <br>
    • We plan to build as many kits, maps and game modes as possible to keep the gameplay fun and fresh.
